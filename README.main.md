Here's an analysis of potential vulnerabilities in the provided code:

1. **SQL Injection (FruitHandler):** In the `FruitHandler` `post` method, you construct a SQL query using string concatenation. This can lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities. It's recommended to use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection. Here's a safer way to write the query:

    ```python
    cursor.execute("UPDATE fruits SET quantity = ? WHERE id = ?", (self.get_argument("quantity"), id))
    ```

2. **Password Handling (LoginHandler):** In the `LoginHandler` `post` method, you directly include user inputs in the SQL query, which is risky. You should hash passwords on the client side and use parameterized queries to check for valid login credentials. Additionally, consider implementing password hashing on the server side for improved security.

3. **Lack of Input Validation (LoginHandler):** There's no input validation on the username and password inputs in the `LoginHandler`. You should validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent malicious input.

4. **No CSRF Protection:** There's no CSRF protection implemented in the code. You should use Tornado's built-in CSRF protection or implement your own to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

5. **Hardcoded Secret (Application Settings):** The `cookie_secret` is hardcoded in the application settings. It's better to use a secure method to generate a random secret for better security.

6. **No HTTPS:** The code does not enforce the use of HTTPS. For secure data transmission, it's crucial to use HTTPS to encrypt data between the client and server.

7. **No Authentication/Authorization Checks (FruitHandler):** While there's an authentication check in the `FruitHandler`, it doesn't include proper authorization checks. Ensure that users are authorized to perform the action they are trying to execute.

8. **Error Handling:** The code lacks proper error handling. Implement error handling to provide meaningful error messages and log potential issues.

9. **Database Connection Handling:** Database connections are opened at the module level. It's recommended to use a context manager or a connection pool for better resource management.

10. **Static File Handling:** Ensure that static files, such as CSS and JavaScript files, are served securely and have appropriate access controls.

11. **Secure Cookies:** While you're using secure cookies, ensure that the `Secure` attribute is set in a production environment to transmit cookies over HTTPS only.

12. **Client-Side Security:** While this code focuses on the server-side, it's important to implement client-side security practices to protect against client-side vulnerabilities.

It's important to address these issues to improve the security of your Tornado web application. Security is a complex topic, and you should consider thorough security testing, including penetration testing, to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.
